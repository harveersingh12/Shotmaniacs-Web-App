# Group 3 Shotmaniacs Web Application

## Description
This repository contains a Java web application developed for Shotmaniacs, as part of the module 4 Data & Information for University of Twente curriculum.

## Important information
- You can find the complete backend api documentation inside `/design` folder containing the api-usage.yaml file
- The DB schema is also inside the `/design` folder, these 2 together can help you map out the backend infrastructure easily
- Trello board link https://trello.com/b/GtiCeWXY/shotmaniacs-group-3

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache Maven installed
- Apache Tomcat installed

## Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.utwente.nl/s3087573/di3shotmaniacs.git
   cd di3shotmaniacs
   
2. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA**
   - Ensure IntelliJ IDEA is installed on your system.
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and import the project (File -> Open -> Navigate to project directory -> Select pom.xml).
   - IntelliJ IDEA should automatically recognize the project as a Maven project and import the necessary dependencies.

3. **Configure Tomcat Server**
   - Configure Apache Tomcat in IntelliJ IDEA as an Application Server:
   - Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.
   - Click the + button and select Tomcat Server -> Local.
   - Choose an existing Tomcat installation or configure a new one by specifying the Tomcat installation directory.
   - Apply the changes.

4. **Build and Run the Project**
   - Ensure the project builds successfully:
     - Click on the green hammer icon or use Ctrl + F9 to build the project.
   - Deploy the application to Tomcat:
     - Create a run configuration by clicking on the + icon, Select Tomcat Local. Ensure in the server tab the url is set to: `http://localhost:8080/shotmaniacs_war/` and in the deployment tab, press the + button and add the shotmaniacs:war **artifact**.
     - Click on the green play button or use Shift + F10 to run the application on the configured Tomcat server.

5. **Access the application**
   - Once the application is deployed, access it at `http://localhost:8080/shotmaniacs_war/`

6. **Use the application**
    - When you first access `http://localhost:8080/shotmaniacs_war/` you will see the homepage of our application. This is meant for
the customers to create bookings that can later be managed by the website's admins and crew members.
    - By accessing `http://localhost:8080/shotmaniacs_war/login.html` you can login as an administrator or crew member. When you login you
be redirected to the corresponding dashboard of your account's role.
   - <span style="color: lightgreen"> <b> ADMIN DASHBOARD: </b></span>

        - First, start by logging in as an administrator using the following details: `Username: root`  and `Password: Root1!root`. (in case it doesn't
      log you in after the first "Log in" button press, then press it twice).
        - In the admin dashboard you can test various features, like managing bookings, crew members accounts, and sending announcements to crew members.
        - In the begining the dashboard may look a like a little bit empty, so we recommend adding events by completing the form on the home page, and adding crew members by selecting "Create member account" in the navigation dropdown menu called "Services".
        - To edit booking information click on any booking.
        - To send announcements use the menu in the right side of the admin dashboard.
        - To add crew members select "Create Member Account" in the nav bar.
        - To change crew member's job select "Member Job" in the nav bar.
        - To see and manage all the crew members select "Crew Tab" in the nav bar, and then press on the desired member.
        - üê£ EASTER EGG: If you type "flappy bird" in the announcement box, set the priority to high, and then press "SEND", a flappy bird game will appear on the screen. üê£ 
   - <span style="color: lightgreen;"><b> CREW DASHBOARD: </b> </span>
        - First you should create an account with the "crew member" role in the admin dash board.
            - <b> Notice!</b>: A crew member cannot be a "production manager", and when creating a password for the crew member account, you need one that is longer than 8 characters, and contains a number, capital letter, and special character. We recommend using: <b>Crew1!crew</b>
        - After creating the crew member account in the admin dashboard, log out as an admin, and then login back with the newly created account.
        - In the crew member dashboard you can see the events you are enrolled into and the admin's announcements. If the account is newly created, you probably do not see anything.
        - To enroll in events go to "Enroll in booking" in the nav bar.
        - There you are going to see all the bookings that <b> an admin has accepted </b> and if you press on either of them, you can see more details, and then enroll.
   
## Additional Configuration
Normally, the application would keep the database login info and email login info inside a `.env` file which would contain all the sensitive login information necessary to run the server. However, we chose to save the login information directly in the code for ease of testing. So there is no need to load any external environmental files. This is not really a security concern currently, as the git repository is set to private.
